              Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer 12 years ago,
              I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
              collaborated with talented people to create digital products for
              both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally
              curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops.
